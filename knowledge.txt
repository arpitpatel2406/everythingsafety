All Sale Statuses in the Lightspeed X‑Series API
SAVED — A parked or draft sale (in progress) that can still have line items, payments, or customer data added. Typically transitions to CLOSED.

CLOSED — A completed sale; inventory counts are updated.

ONACCOUNT — A sale made on credit; payment pending. Reduces inventory. Should transition to ONACCOUNT_CLOSED after full payment.

ONACCOUNT_CLOSED — A fully paid account sale. Like CLOSED, it should only go to VOIDED if cancelled.

LAYBY — A deposit-based sale; partial payment made.

LAYBY_CLOSED — A layby sale that's been paid off in full.

AWAITING_DISPATCH — Sale is pending shipping (commonly for e‑commerce).

AWAITING_PICKUP — Sale is pending customer pickup (usually e‑commerce).

DISPATCHED_CLOSED — The sale marked as awaiting dispatch has now been shipped.

PICKED_UP_CLOSED — The sale awaiting pickup has now been collected by the customer.

SERVICE — A sale containing one or more labor/service items; still in progress.

SERVICE_CLOSED — A service sale that is fully paid and completed.

VOIDED — A cancelled sale; inventory is returned and all related payments are removed.


What to Include as "Valid Sales" for EOD Count?
To capture all valid and completed sales at the end of the day (EOD), you’d typically include:

CLOSED

ONACCOUNT_CLOSED

LAYBY_CLOSED

DISPATCHED_CLOSED

PICKED_UP_CLOSED

You might also consider including:

ONACCOUNT (if you're counting credit sales even before full payment)

LAYBY (if counting deposit-based but not yet closed)

SERVICE (if service transactions in progress are relevant to your reporting)
